# Global Stock Market & Macroeconomic Analysis
**Portfolio Project – Data Analysis, Visualization, and Business Insights**

## Overview
This project explores the relationship between global stock indices and key macroeconomic indicators such as GDP, inflation, and unemployment. Using Python, pandas, and real-world datasets (Kaggle, World Bank, FRED), I analyze trends, volatility, and the impact of major events (like COVID-19) across multiple countries.

## Key Questions
- How do global stock markets respond to macroeconomic changes?
- What is the correlation between market performance and GDP, inflation, and unemployment?
- How did stocks and risk behave during real-world shocks (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic)?

## Datasets Used
- **Stock Indices**: Kaggle "Global Stock Indices Historical Data"
- **Macroeconomic Data**: World Bank WDI (GDP, inflation), FRED (US Unemployment Rate)

## Approach
- Data cleaning and time-series transformation
- Calculation of returns, volatility, and moving averages
- Visual and statistical analysis of macro-market relationships
- Business-focused insights explained with clear, plain-language notebook comments and charts

## Highlights
- Visualizes global market dynamics and macro context
- Shows real-world crisis response (COVID-19 crash)
- Strong, actionable insights for finance and business audiences

## Key Insights
- Stock market performance often correlates with changes in GDP and unemployment—though the strength and direction vary by country and time period.
- Markets react strongly (both price and volatility) to macro shocks.
- Clear, commented code demonstrates my ability to work with real data, extract business value, and communicate insights effectively.

## How To Run
1. Clone this repo and place the CSV data files in the main folder.
2. Launch `Jupyter Notebook` and run `analysis.ipynb`.
3. All code is fully commented for a non-technical audience.
